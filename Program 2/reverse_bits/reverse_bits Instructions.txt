Write a function named reverse_bits that reverses the order of the bits in a 1-byte value of type unsigned char. A common programming question in job interviews is, "reverse the letters (or words) in a string." But for a systems programming interview, you might get the question, "reverse the bits in a byte." For example, the call of reverse_bits(187) should return 221. Your solution does not have to be in-place, and can use variables to hold temporary variables.
