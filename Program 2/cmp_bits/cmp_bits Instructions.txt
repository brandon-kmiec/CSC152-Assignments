Write a function named cmp_bits that accepts two int arguments a and b, and compares the number of "on" bits (number of 1s) between them. Returns a negative result if the bitwise representation of a has fewer 1s than b, a positive result if a has more 1s than b, and zero if both have the same number of 1s. For example, if a is 5 (binary 00000000000000000000000000000101) and b is 32 (binary 00000000000000000000000000010000), then cmp_bits returns any positive number (for example, it could return 1).
