There is no need to memorize the entire ASCII table, but knowing the placement of a few key characters from which you can then find neighbors is worthwhile. Use man ascii to learn the codes for the three characters '0', 'A', 'a', and use them to do the following conversions. Write your answer in the form 0x__.

hex for 'I' = 73_d = 73_d/16_d = 4_d r 9_d => 4_d/16_d = 0_d r 4_d => 0x49
hex for '5' = 53_d = 53_d/16_d = 3_d r 5_d => 3_d/16_d = 0_d r 3_d => 0x35
hex for 'd' = 100_d = 100_d/16_d = 6_d r 4_d => 6_d/16_d = 0_d r 6_d => 0x64
