I've graded Program 11. You got 5/5 if your sign and verify worked for the following test case

If it did not, you still got 2.5/5 if your sign and verify worked for the test case from the assignment writeup.

The number one cause for loss of points appeared to be lack of testing on large numbers. Some miscellaneous points were deducted in a few cases for not following the spec.
